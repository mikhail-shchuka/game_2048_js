## Description

You can choose the level of difficulty - the size of the field for the game and change it during the game (this will reset progress and the game will start again). To play, you need to move the game slots with the arrows on the keyboard or with movements on the screen of your tablet/phone so that the blocks with the same numbers overlap. In this case they will sum up into one block and the result will be added to the score. Each action generates a new block with a value of 2 or 4 (with probability 10 to 1). If after generating a new block you have no possible action that will change the playing field - the game is over with a loss. But if you manage to get to the block with the number 2048 - congratulations, you won!
